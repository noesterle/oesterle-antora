= Donatorio

This project was an academic project that was not focused on the programming complexity.
Instead it was focusing on the process of design.
The class was divided into teams, and each team had to think up a project they could create.
My team settled on a donation platform, where charities and users could both join a central service.
Charities would reduce friction for receiving donations, and users would be in a place where they could trust what they're donating to.
We had to come up with a name, we settled on Donatorio, lending itself to the idea behind the platform, sounding technical, and being an interesting word to say.

From there, we had to flesh out usecases, draw wire diagrams, pick colorschemes, perform user testing on those in and out of class, incorporate feedback on the design, and creating a final User Interface with some basic functionality.
