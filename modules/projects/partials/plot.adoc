= Movie Plot Scrambler

I created this project in order to familiarize myself with some basic front end development.
This project combines work with the Angular Framework, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
It allows the user to search for a movie, and scrambles the description of it by finding synonyms for each individual word so that the whole description losses all meaning.
It gets the movie description from https://www.omdbapi.com/[OMDB's API], and find synonyms using the https://www.wordsapi.com/[WordsAPI] which is available through https://rapidapi.com/[RapidAPI].
The OMDB API call is a single API call per movie, and each word is asynchronously submitted as an API call and updated as a response is returned.
Each service offers a free tier, OMDB will stop responding while RapidAPI will charge for API calls over the free amount.
